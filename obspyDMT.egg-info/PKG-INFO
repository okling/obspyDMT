Description: obspyDMT (ObsPy Data Management Tool) is a command line tool for retrieving, 
        processing and management of massive seismic data in a fully automatic way 
        which could be run in serial or in parallel. 
        Moreover, complementary processing and managing tools have been 
        designed and introduced in addition to the obspyDMT options. 
        Because of the modular nature, different functionalities could be added 
        easily and/or each obspyDMT can be used as a module for other programs.
